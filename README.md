3. **Create Environment Files**:
    The project requires two environment configuration files to run locally and in production. Follow these steps to create them:

    - Navigate to the `src/` directory in the project folder.
    - Create a folder named `environments` if it doesn't already exist.
    - Inside the `src/environments/` folder, create the following two files:

      1. **`environment.ts` (Development)**
      ```typescript
      export const environment = {
        production: false,
        backendUrl: 'http://localhost:5000'  // Your local backend URL
      };
      ```

      2. **`environment.prod.ts` (Production)**
      ```typescript
      export const environment = {
        production: true,
        backendUrl: 'https://your-production-backend-url.com'  // Your live backend URL
      };
      ```

4. **Run the Project Locally**:
    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```

    Your application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.
